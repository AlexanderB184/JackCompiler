Jack Syntactic Elements

White Space and Comments:

Space characters, newline characters and comments are ignored

// Comment to end of line 
/* Comment until closing */
/** API documentation comment */

Symbols:
( )     Used for grouping arithmetic expressions and enclosing parameters for parameter lists and argument lists.
[ ]     Used for array indexing
{ }     Used for grouping program units and statements
,       Variable list seperator
;       Statement terminator
=       Assignment and comparison operator
.       Class membership
+ - * / & | ~ < > Operators

Reserved Words:
class, constructor, method, function        Program components
int, char, boolean, void                    Primitive types
var, static, field                          Variable declarations
let, do, if, else, while, return            Statements
true, false, null                           Constant values
this                                        Object reference

Constants:
Integer Constants must be positive and in standard decimal notation, e.g. 1984. 
Negative integers are expressions consisting of a positive integer constant with the unary minus operator.

String Constants are enclosed with double quotes (") characters and may contain any character except for newline and double quote. 
(These are provided by String.newLine() and String.doubleQuote() from the standard library)

Boolean Constants are true or false.

The constant null signifies a null reference.

Identifiers:

Identifiers are an arbitrarily long sequence of letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0,9) and underscore "_". The first character must be a letter or an underscore.
The language is case sensitive, therfore 'x' and 'X' are treated differently.
